The word features above cause the classifier to not do well, as it causes many false negatives to occur and has low recall, meaning it is not very good at identifying spam. However, the precision is relatively high still, and very few ham emails were accidentally mislabelled.

In order to get full credit on the accuracy part of this assignment, you must get at least **88%** accuracy on the evaluation set. To see your accuracy on the evaluation set, you will use your classifier to predict every email in the `evaluation` DataFrame and upload your predictions to Kaggle.\n",

    "These plots show characters in email texts vs. separate words in email texts for each Ham and Spam emails respectively. Ham emails seem to follow a largely linear function, while spam emails deviate heavily, especially when characters surpasses 2000. Most spam emails are also concentrated in the 0-1000 character range while ham emails are typically between 0-2500 characters. Spam emails typically have more characters than separate words by a higher margin than ham emails, as exhibited by the higher slope of the ham email values in the plot. However, when trying to implement a feature which took this into account, I failed to make any meaningful progress."

    "\n",
    "We can trade off between precision and recall. In most cases we won't be able to get both perfect precision (i.e. no false positives) and recall (i.e. no false negatives), so we have to compromise. For example, in the case of cancer screenings, false negatives are comparatively worse than false positives — a false negative means that a patient might not discover a disease until it's too late to treat, while a false positive means that a patient will probably have to take another screening.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that logistic regression calculates the probability that an example belongs to a certain class. Then, to classify an example we say that an email is spam if our classifier gives it $\\ge 0.5$ probability of being spam. However, *we can adjust that cutoff*: we can say that an email is spam only if our classifier gives it $\\ge 0.7$ probability of being spam, for example. This is how we can trade off false positives and false negatives.\n",

In the cell below, [plot a precision-recall curve](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/model_selection/plot_precision_recall.html#plot-the-precision-recall-curve) for your final classifier (the one you use to make predictions for Kaggle)."
